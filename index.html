								<h2>hey! my name is Maize <br />I am a Software engineer with a focus on full stack development, and also <br />Multidisciplined Artist based in the PNW.<br /></h2>
								<br><p>My tale is a tale of resilience, gumption, and bravery, it starts on the east coast to the west and across the pond, all with a dedication to learning to grow and evolving my freelance design career into the tech world.<br /></p>
								I started my career as a Game Dev before graduating and working as a freelance Graphic Design Career for several years. I started my own surface design brand called "Amaizink LLC" and have been featured in blogs, articles, and newspapers for my signature pattern designs.<br /></p>
								<br><p>My long-term dream is to buy a house and land where I can continue my journey as a software engineer and work on projects in natural beauty and games as well as short stories. My ultimate goal and 100 hr project will continue my creative journey by blending my art/tech/story writing that connects creatives around the world.</p>
