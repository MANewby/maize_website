								<h2>hey! my name is Maize <br />I am a Software Developer & <br />Multidisciplined Artist based in the PNW.<br /></h2>
								<br><p>My tale is a tale of resilience, gumption, and bravery, it starts on the east coast to the west and across the pond, all with a dedication to learning to grow and evolving my freelance design career into the tech world.<br /></p>

								<br><p>My long-term dream is to buy a house and land where I can continue my journey as a software engineer and work on projects in natural beauty and games as well as short stories. My ultimate goal and 100 hr project will continue my creative journey by blending my art/tech/story writing that connects creatives around the world.</p>
